Simulations run for varying conditions

1) Horizontal and Verticle dumbbell starting positions
2) Varying tension (by varying number of solute beads inside vesicle

A script for creating the vesicle and above conditions with the input LAMMPS script can be found 
(/Simulations) with an example output & instructions

These simulations were analysed using the two scripts in Analysis

Which gives an output files theta_*.dat and wrapping_*.dat which are then used in the plotting scripts


To access simulations, see instructions for logging into RDSS (from Myriad)
